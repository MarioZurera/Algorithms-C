# Algorithms-C
This project aims to develop some of the more fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms in the C language.  
Suggestions, issues and recommendations are welcome.

For a more practical implementation of this project in programs you can go to my [42 Common Core](https://github.com/MarioZurera/42/) project.  
For consistency, this project is in *Libftv3*, library included in the C projects of the Common Core.


You can also check my [LeetCode](https://github.com/MarioZurera/LeetCode/) project for a solution using a different language to some of the algorithms present in this project. 

## Data Structures for this project
Array  
List  
String  
Set  
Map  
Binary Tree  
Graph  


## Algorithms for this project

After develop the DS, you will find a folder "Algorithms" with some interesting problems solves from:

LeetCode  
NeetCode  
CodingGame  
(more pages will be included when I discover them)  


**Because abstraction is the way to go.**
