# Algorithms-C
This project aims to develop some of the more fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms in the C language.  
Suggestions, issues and recommendations are welcome.

For a more practical implementation of this project in programs you can go to my [42 Common Core](https://github.com/MarioZurera/42/) project.  
For consistency, this project is in *Libftv3*, library included in the C projects of the Common Core.


You can also check my [LeetCode](https://github.com/MarioZurera/LeetCode/) project for a solution using a different language to some of the algorithms present in this project. 

## Data Structures for this project
 - [Array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_type)#Abstract_arrays)
 - [List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type))
 - [String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science))
 - [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type))
 - [Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array)
 - [Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure))
 - [Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type))
 - [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))
 - [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))

And some [typical operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type#Typical_operations) for each of them.


## Algorithms for this project

After develop the DS, you will find a folder "Algorithms" with some interesting problems solves from:

 - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)
 - [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/problems/dynamicArray)
 - [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/training)

<br />

**Because abstraction is the way to go.**
